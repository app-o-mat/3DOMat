3D-o-Mat is a simple iPhone and iPad app to take 3D photos that you can view with Red/Cyan 3D glasses (sold separately).

To make a 3D Photo

1. Point your device at the subject and tap the left camera button.

2. Move your device slightly to the right and tap the right camera button.

3. Look at the photo with Red/Cyan 3D Glasses with the cyan lens on your left eye and the red lens on your right. If your glasses have the red lens on the left, you can swap the red/cyan sides using the info button menu on the bottom right of the screen.

You can save them to your photo album or share them with other apps and on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter.
